# Text Generation

This folder contains code for third problem in fourth Programming Assignment of CS671-Deep Learning and its Applications, offered at IIT Mandi in Feb-May, 2019, namely Text Generation.

## Problem Statement

Given a text file, in our case a famous novel written by Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice, our RNN model generates words after getting a seed sequence of words.

## Getting Started

We simply need to run the txt_gen.py and change the pathname to our text's. Also the code uses utf-8 encoding so it might not work on terminals that do not support that.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6
- Tensorflow 1.13.1
- Keras
- Matplotlib: 3.0.2
- Numpy 1.16.1
- Pandas 0.24.1
