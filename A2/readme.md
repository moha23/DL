"gravity_simulator_tf.py" calculates all the positions and velocitites till the threshold condition is reached. The positions and velocities of every iteration are also saved in .npy files at output_position.npy and output_velocities.npy.
scatter plot of the positions at every iteration is plotted.
Video of the scatter plot is made.
Gravity simulator is also implemented in python at "gravity_simulator_python.py" to check the difference in duration.
tensorflow implementation takes 61 seconds while implementation in python takes 31 seconds.
