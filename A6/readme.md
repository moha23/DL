# Pixelwise Image Segmentation

## Problem Statement

In this problem, we were provided with Data folder for eye images and corresponding masks in separate Mask folder. Our task was to learn the model in such a way that it takes eye as input image and produces mask for iris (which is in contour shape). For example, if we have given an input image (as shown in Figure 1) then output should be mask as given in Figure 2.
